	<h1 id="ad">Afghanistan Update news</h1>
	<p>Under Taliban rule, female judges in Afghanistan have reportedly been tortured and received death threats. Hundreds were forced into hiding, worried that those they'd convicted would now come to seek their revenge after being released from prison.
    BBC Newsnight's Sima Kotecha spoke exclusively to female judges who have just arrived in the UK as part of a government rescue mission organised by Baroness Kennedy and the International Bar Association.
    The BBC is not using their names for the safety of those they left behind.</p>

    <h2>Why China is still trying to achieve zero Covid</h2>
    <p class="a">High vaccination rates meant people might still contract Covid-19, but not have to go to hospital.
    As a result, borders elsewhere are opening to international travel. In China however, visas for foreigners remain hard to come by and Chinese people are still not having their passports renewed after they expire.
    Elsewhere, people are "living with the virus". Not in China, where yet another Delta outbreak is being attacked with the same zeal as before the vaccine.
     If the official figures are accurate, over 1,000 local transmissions have been recorded since October. The figure is not that high, but the spread is significant, hitting 21 provinces. This matters because even a couple of cases in China will trigger the same strict measures as hundreds or thousands of new infections.</p><img src="bbc 2.jpg">

     <p>Authorities in the Indian capital, Delhi, have shut all schools and colleges indefinitely amid the worsening levels of air pollution.
        Construction work has also been banned until 21 November but an exception has been made for transport and defence-related projects.
        Only five of the 11 coal-based power plants in the city have been allowed to operate.
         A toxic haze has smothered Delhi since the festival of Diwali.
         The levels of PM2.5 - tiny particles that can clog people's lungs - in Delhi are far higher than the World Health Organization's (WHO) safety guidelines. Several parts of the city recorded figures close to or higher than 400 on Tuesday, which is categorised as "severe".</p><img src="bbc 3.jpg">

         <h2><i>Evil Corp: 'My hunt for the world's most wanted hackers'</h2></i>
         <p class="a">Many of the people on the FBI's cyber most wanted list are Russian. While some allegedly work for the government earning a normal salary, others are accused of making a fortune from ransomware attacks and online theft. If they left Russia they'd be arrested - but at home they appear to be given free rein.

"We're wasting our time," I thought, as I watched a cat licking the carcass of a discarded takeaway chicken.

Surely there would no longer be any trace of an alleged multi-millionaire cyber-criminal on this dilapidated estate in a run-down town 700km (400 miles) east of Moscow.

But I pressed on with an interpreter and cameraman, shooing the mangy cat away from the entrance to the block of flats.

When we knocked at one of the doors, a young man answered and a curious elderly woman peered around the corner at us from the kitchen.

"Igor Turashev? No, I don't recognise the name," he said.

"His family is registered here, so who are you?" we asked.</p><img src="bbc4.png">
